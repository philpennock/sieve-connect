# record, then you might want to change the default port-number in the
# parentheses here:
my $DEFAULT_PORT = 'sieve(4190)';

# These are the defaults, some may be overriden on the command-line.
# Note that SSLv23_client_method in OpenSSL is the *only* one which can
# negotiate multiple protocols, so even to choose TLS v1.0/v1.1/v1.2, you
# must still specify SSLv23 and then cancel the undesired protocols.

	# Most portable to let this be discovered automatically, but
	# an installation might override it here:
	#SSL_ca_path	=> '/etc/ssl/certs',
);
# These defaults can be overriden on the cmdline:
my ($forbid_clearauth, $forbid_clearchan) = (0, 0);

# Note Well: if SSL/TLS verification is enabled, that is equivalent to
# $forbid_clearchan, since no TLS means no verification possible.  But
# if verification is not required then by default clearchan is allowed, not
# just unverified TLS.  The command-line overrides these.
# This is a breaking change between v0.87 and v0.88 as these semantics were
# firmed up and --clearchan was added to restore the old default behaviour
# if TLS was never offered but verification was enabled.
#
# I expect this to cause complaints as it's not backwards compatible, but the
# old behaviour was susceptible to MitM connection downgrade by removing the
# capability advertisement.  The new behaviour is a security improvement, and
# the old semantics can be obtained by explicitly setting --clearchan.

	# The current protocol spec says that the capability response must
	# be sent by the server after TLS is established by STARTTLS,
	# without the client issuing a request.  So after TLS,
	# server-goes-first.  The historical behaviour of Cyrus timseived
	# is the inverse; the server waits after TLS for the client to issue
	# CAPABILITY.  That historical behaviour is still what happens in
	# the current 'stable' release branch of Cyrus IMAP.
	# To accommodate both, we need to be able to resynchronise to
	# reality, so that we can get back to command-response.
	# We can't just check to see if there's data to read or not, since
	# that will break if the next data is delayed (race condition).
	# There was no protocol-compliant method to determine this, short
	# of "wait a while, see if anything comes along; if not, send
	# CAPABILITY ourselves".  So, I broke protocol by sending the
	# non-existent command NOOP, then scan for the resulting NO.
	# This at least is stably deterministic.  However, from draft 10
	# onwards, NOOP is a registered available extension which returns
	# OK.
	#
	# New problem: again, Cyrus timsieved.  As of 2.3.13, it drops the
	# connection for an unknown command instead of returning NO.  And
	# logs "Lost connection to client -- exiting" which is an interesting
	# way of saying "we dropped the connection".  At this point, I give up
	# on protocol-deterministic checks and fall back to version checking.
	# Alas, Cyrus 2.2.x is still widely deployed because 2.3.x is the
	# development series and 2.2.x is officially the stable series.
	# This means that if they don't support NOOP by 2.3.14, I have to

	# precisely was the first to send the capability response correctly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<sieve-connect> is a client for the C<MANAGESIEVE> protocol, which is
an RFC-specified protocol for manipulation of C<Sieve> scripts in a
repository.
More simply, B<sieve-connect> lets you control your mail-filtering
rule files on a mail server.

B<sieve-connect> can be invoked with an action from the command-line
to make it easy to script one-shot actions, it can be provided with
a script file or it can be left to enter an interactive command-loop,
where it supports tab-completion (if the supporting Perl module is
available) and basic navigation of the local
file-system in the style of C<FTP> clients.

B<sieve-connect> supports the use of C<TLS> via the C<STARTTLS> command,
including authentication via client certificates.
C<sieve-connect> also supports whichever C<SASL> mechanisms your
F<Authen::SASL::Perl> library provides, as long as they do not require
SASL protection layers.

In Interactive mode, a C<help> command is available.  Command parameters
with a C<%> in them are examined to see if they match C<%KEYWORD>, where
C<KEYWORD> is always in upper-case.  The list of keywords may be retrieved
with the C<keywords> command and includes items such as C<%DATE>, C<%USER>,
etc.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option names may be given as the shortest unique prefix.

The remote sieve script name defaults to the same as the local sieve
script name, so just specify the local one if only one is needed; it
was a deliberate decision to have the defaults this way around, to make
people think about names in the local filesystem.  There is no default
script name.

The B<--debug> option turns on diagnostic traces.
The B<--debugsasl> option asks the SASL library for debugging.
The B<--dumptlsinfo> shows the TLS (SSL) peer information; if specified
together with B<--debug> then the server's PEM certificate will be
provided as debug trace.

The B<--version> option shows version information.
When combined with B<--debug> it will show implementation dependency versions.
The B<--help> and B<--man> options provide usage information.

The server can be a host or IP address, IPv4 or IPv6.

If a server is provided by B<--server> then that takes precedence.
If that option is not present, then C<$IMAP_SERVER> from the environment is
checked and, if it's not a unix-domain socket path, is used with any port
specification stripped off.

For TLS verification, this is the default name used for hostnames (both SNI and
verification); no information derived from DNS is currently used as the trusted
hostname identifier.  (This is subject to change in future, given DNSSEC).  The
B<--tlshostname> option can be used to override the name used for TLS.

Next, unless B<--nosrv> is given, checks are made for SRV records so as to search
for a default server; if the F<Mozilla::PublicSuffix> Perl module is available,
these checks are done for every level of the hostname upto (but not including)
the public suffix.
If that module is not available, a crude heuristic is used: as long as there
are three dots in the hostname, SRV records for the part of the hostname after
the first dot are tried.
If this is inappropriate, install F<Mozilla::PublicSuffix>.

If no SRV records are found which point to a 'sieve', 'imaps' or 'imap'
protocol service, of if a record is found which says "no such service in
this domain" (by having a target of "."), then the final default server
is F<localhost>.

The port can be any Perl port specification, default is F<sieve(4190)>.
A port from an SRV record will take precedence.  The Perl specification
provides a name to look up in the system services database (F</etc/services>)
followed in parentheses by a default value to use if the name is not found.
Thus this default will honour a value of 2000 from F</etc/services>.

The B<--4> or B<--6> options may be used to coerce IPv4 or IPv6.

By default, the server is taken to be a domain, for which SRV records are
looked up; use B<--nosrv> to inhibit SRV record lookup.

The B<--user> option will be required unless you're on a Unix system
with getpwuid() available and your Cyrus account name matches your system
account name.  B<--authmech> can be used to force a particular authentication
mechanism.  B<--authzid> can be used to request authorisation to act as
the specified id.
B<--realm> can be used to try to pass realm information to the authentication
mechanism.
If you want to provide a password programmatically,
use B<--passwordfd> to state which file descriptor (typically F<0>)
the password can be read from.
Everything until the newline before EOF is the password,
so it can contain embedded newlines.  Do not provide passwords on a
command-line or in a process environment.

Unless modified at install/packaging time, by default SSL certificate authority
certificates are searched for.
The first attempt is to try, in turn, for environment variables
C<$SSL_CERT_DIR> & C<$SSL_CERT_FILE> which are the names supported by the
OpenSSL library and so often supported by client commands.
Next, if the OpenSSL command C<version> is available and the output
C<OPENSSLDIR> can be parsed and the C<certs> directory exists within that
directory, then that location will be used.
Finally, a fixed list of common locations are searched and the first one to
exist is used.  Invoking with B<--debug> will show more details during the
C<setup:> phase.

Precedence above these defaults is given to the B<--tlscafile> option if
given, else the B<--tlscapath> option if that is given.
The former is one file containing certificates, the latter is a directory.

Alternatively, if you are willing to accept the risk of man-in-the-middle
active attacks and you are unable to arrange for the relevant Certificate
Authority certificate to be available, then you can lower your safety with the
B<--notlsverify> option, also spelt B<--nosslverify>.

If verification is requested (the default) but TLS is not available, we
do not fall back to cleartext insecure communications.  Use B<--clearchan>
to change that, or set C<$SIEVECONNECT_INSECURE_CLEARTEXT_FALLBACK> non-empty
in the environment.

If you don't want to (only) rely on CA systems you can explicitly set an
expected server certificate fingerprint using the B<--tlscertfingerprint>
option, also spelt B<--sslcertfingerprint>.  If you wish to ignore CA
validation, you still need to disable that explicitly (see above), as the
default is to add an extra constraint (pinning, within valid CA certificates).
This option specifies the X.509 certificate fingerprint (not a public key
fingerprint), as given by OpenSSL.  The first part of the value should be an
algorithm name, such as C<sha256> or C<sha1>.  That is followed by a colon, and
then the fingerprint data in its usual colon-delimited hexadecimal notation.
Eg: C<--tlscertfingerprint sha256:24:B4:..28-more-fields..:A8:58>

For SSL client certificate authentication, either B<--clientkeycert> may
be used to refer to a file with both the key and cert present or both
B<--clientkey> and B<--clientcert> should point to the relevant files.
The data should be in PEM file-format.

The B<--noclearauth> option will prevent use of cleartext authentication
mechanisms unless protected by TLS.  The B<--noclearchan> option will
mandate use of some confidentiality layer; at this time only TLS is
supported.

By default, the server's "VERSION" capability will be used to filter the
commands available.  Use B<--ignoreserverversion> to prevent this.

The remaining options denote actions.  One, and only one, action may be
present.  If no action is present, the interactive mode is entered.
If the exec action is present, commands are read from the script
instead.

=over 4

=item B<--upload>
will upload a script to the server.

=item B<--download>
will download a script from the server.

=item B<--list>
will list the scripts which exist on the server.
One of those scripts might be marked ACTIVE.

=item B<--delete>
will delete a script from the server.

=item B<--checkscript>
will ask the server to validate the local file provided.

=item B<--edit>
will download a script, invoke an editor upon it, ask the server to
check the results (and offer to re-edit if the server rejects it) and finally
upload the result.

=item B<--activate>
will mark the specified remote script as the active one.

=item B<--deactivate>
will remove the active mark from the specified remote script
without activating a replacement.

=item B<--exec>
will take a file-name containing commands as though given in the normal
read-eval-print loop.

=back

Note that B<--check> and B<--edit> require a server which advertises
a "VERSION" capability, see B<--ignoreserverversion> to override.

(If B<--server> is not explicitly stated, it may be provided at the end of
the command-line for compatibility with sieveshell.)

=head1 EXAMPLES

Connect to a Sieve server and enter interactive mode, when you already have a
Kerberos ticket and GSSAPI/Kerberos is available:

    $ sieve-connect --server imap.example.org
    ReadLine support enabled.
    >

Do the same, but with C<$IMAP_SERVER> set in environ:

    $ sieve-connect
    ReadLine support enabled.
    >

Upload a script from the current directory, being prompted to authenticate;
note that the script won't be activated (uploading just makes it available,
possibly with the server having first checked it for errors):

    $ sieve-connect --server imap.example.org --user fred@example.org \
         --localsieve fred.siv --upload
    Sieve/IMAP Password: [password here, not shown]
    $

See a lot of what's happening under the covers:

    $ sieve-connect --debug
    [ snip 30 or so lines ]
    >

Use B<--passwordfd> to supply the password using stdio instead of argv or
environ, where it might show up in process listings; this example assumes a
shell with "here-strings", such as zsh or bash:

    $   password='...'
    $ sieve-connect --authmech digest-md5 --passwordfd=5 5<<<"$password"
    ReadLine support enabled.
    >

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

C<$IMAP_SERVER> for a default IMAP server.

C<$USERNAME> and C<$LOGNAME> where the C<getpwuid()> function is not available.

C<$SSL_CERT_DIR> and C<$SSL_CERT_FILE> for locating default
Certificate Authority trust anchors.

C<$SIEVECONNECT_INSECURE_CLEARTEXT_FALLBACK> to preserve old poor hygiene
around TLS fallback.

C<$VISUAL>, else C<$EDITOR>, for the edit action.

=head1 BUGS

If the authentication protocol negotiates a protection layer then things
will rapidly Go Bad.  A mitigating factor is that no protection layer
should be negotiated whilst under STARTTLS protection.  Just use TLS!

When listing scripts, the format is based upon the raw server output,
assuming that the server uses quoted-strings for the script names.  The
output is just passed back on the basis that it's a fairly good interface
to pass to a program.  But a server could choose to use literal strings,
even though the results are defined as line-break separated -- that would
mean that some linebreaks are special.  Hopefully no server will do this.

If B<sieve-connect> fails to connect to an IPv4 server without the B<-4>
option being explicitly passed, then you've encountered a portability
issue in the F<IO::Socket::INET6> Perl library and need to upgrade that.

Most historical implementations used port 2000 for ManageSieve.  RFC5804
allocates port 4190.  This tool uses a port-spec of "sieve(4190)" as the
default port, which means that an F</etc/services> (or substitute) entry for
"sieve" as a TCP service takes precedence, but if that is not present, will
assume 4190 as the default.  This change means that if you're still using
port 2000 and do not have an F</etc/services> entry, updating to/beyond release
0.75 of this tool will break invocations which do not specify a port.  The
specification of the default port was moved to the user-configurable section
at the top of the script and administrators may wish to override the shipped
default.  You can bypass all of this mess by publishing SRV records,
per RFC5804.

The Net::DNS Perl module does not (at time of writing) provide full support for
weighted prioritised SRV records and I have not made any effort to fix this;
whatever the default sort algorithm provides for SRV is what is used for
ordering.

If you don't specify a server and don't export C<$IMAP_SERVER> in the
environment then the search mechanism is safer and more thorough if the
F<Mozilla::PublicSuffix> Perl module is installed. In particular, if your
hostname is also your domain name and the parent domain is administered
by someone you don't trust, then you'll regret not installing that module.

Probably need to sit down and work through the final RFC and see if any
functionality is still missing.

=head1 NON-BUGS

Actually uses STARTTLS.  Can handle script names with embedded whitespace.
Author needs access to a server which handles embedded quote characters
properly to complete testing of that.

=head1 HISTORY

B<sieve-connect> was written as a demonstration for the C<info-cyrus>
mailing-list, 2006-11-14.  It was a single-action-and-quit script for
scripting purposes.  The command-loop code was written (two days) later
and deliberately designed to be compatible with sieveshell.

Versions prior to 0.85 did not actually verify the peer certificate identity,
although this author stupidly believed that it did.
API/expectations mismatch.

Versions prior to 0.88 defaulted to falling back to cleartext in the absence
of STARTTLS if CA information was configured locally and verification
requested (the default).
Today, this is no longer acceptable for client-server communications; either
verify-and-require-TLS or don't-verify-and-fallback-to-cleartext.
This is the new policy going forward; use B<--clearchan> to allow fallback
while still trying to verify TLS (but why?) or B<--notlsverify> to skip
verification.  Or add C<$SIEVECONNECT_INSECURE_CLEARTEXT_FALLBACK> non-empty
in the environment to avoid the implicit noclearchan-when-verify-enabled.

always have been.  The signing key is in the PGP Strong Set (which means
there's a stronger chance that you can verify the identity of the key owner).
Historically, releases were signed with key C<0x403043153903637F>.  If you're
reading this text from a release, then I've cut a new release since switching
to key C<0x4D1E900E14C1CC04> and I expect that 4096RSA key to be used, barring
major incident.

The source code is available via Git; the authoritative public-facing
repository is currently L<https://github.com/philpennock/sieve-connect> and
pull-requests and bug-reports are accepted there.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

Perl.  F<Authen::SASL>.  F<IO::Socket::INET6>.
F<IO::Socket::SSL> (at least version 1.14).  F<Pod::Usage>.
F<Net::DNS> for SRV lookup.
F<Pod::Simple::Text> for built-in man command (optional).
F<Term::ReadKey> to get passwords without echo.
Various other Perl modules which are believed to be standard.
F<Term::ReadLine> will significantly improve interactive mode.
F<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> will improve it further by allowing tab-completion.
